# Rishav Raj - Developer

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! I am Rishav Raj, a developer who discovered my interest in programming during my first semester and have been teaching myself ever since. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skillset and make a meaningful impact in the field of programming.

I have a strong foundation in frontend development and am currently expanding my skillset to include full stack development, data structures, and algorithms. Also exploring AWS. I am proficient in several programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java, as well as web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JWT, and RESTful APIs. I am also familiar with databases such as MongoDB and Firebase, and have experience with other tools such as Git, Linux, Postman, and Agile.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a keen interest in sharing my knowledge and insights through writing technical blogs. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
