## Hi there and welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹ !
I'm Rishav Raj, a developer and final-year mechanical engineering student who discovered his true interest in programming. I've always been fascinated by how computers and mobile applications respond to commands. During my first semester, I learnt about programming and began teaching myself how to code. After a few weeks, I realised that this is what I wanted to pursue with my life, and I fell in love with the beauty of programming. It requires a blend of creative and logical problem-solving abilities, and there is always something new to learn.

I have in-depth knowledge of **Frontend Development** and currently, I am learning **Full Stack Development**, **Data Structures**, and **Algorithms**. Apart from this, I also write [Technical Blogs](https://dev.to/iamrishavraj1).

### My current specialization in
+ **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Java
+ **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, JWT, RESTful APIs, MVC
+ **Databases**: MongoDB, Firebase
+ **Other Tools**: Data Structure & Algorithm, Object-Oriented Programming, Git, Linux, Postman, Agile
